    <h1>Tulip</h1>

    <p> A tulip is a bulbous spring-flowering plant that belongs to the genus Tulipa, which is part of the lily family,
        Liliaceae. Tulips are known for their distinctive cup-shaped flowers with vibrant colors and often have a
        single, upright, six-petaled bloom per stem. The flowers can be solid in color or display various patterns,
        including stripes and flames
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Bulbous Plant: Tulips grow from bulbs, which are underground storage structures. The bulbs store nutrients that
        help the plant survive through the dormant period and support the rapid growth of flowers in the spring.
